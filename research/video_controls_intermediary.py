Use a controller class that acts as an intermediary between
the buttons and the canvas.

In this example, we have a VideoController class that takes
the canvas as an argument in its constructor. This class can
have methods like play(), pause(), and stop() that perform
the necessary actions on the canvas.

The VideoApp class is responsible for creating the buttons
and associating them with the appropriate methods of the
VideoController instance. The VideoController instance is
created with the canvas and passed to the VideoApp
constructor.

By using this approach, the buttons have access to the video
canvas through the VideoController instance, allowing you to
control the video playback in an object-oriented way.

Here's an example implementation:
'''

import tkinter as tk

class VideoController:
    def __init__(self, canvas):
        self.canvas = canvas

    def play(self):
        # Logic to play the video on the canvas
        pass

    def pause(self):
        # Logic to pause the video on the canvas
        pass

    def stop(self):
        # Logic to stop the video on the canvas
        pass

class VideoApp:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        self.canvas = tk.Canvas(root)
        self.controller = VideoController(self.canvas)
        self.create_buttons()

    def create_buttons(self):
        play_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Play", command=self.controller.play)
        pause_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Pause", command=self.controller.pause)
        stop_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Stop", command=self.controller.stop)

        play_button.pack()
        pause_button.pack()
        stop_button.pack()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = VideoApp(root)
    root.mainloop()
